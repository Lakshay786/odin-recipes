    <p>Welcome to my page! Today we will learn about how to make <strong>Garlic Bread!</strong></p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl, gently stir, and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a standing electric mixer, add the flour, olive oil, salt, and sugar. Use a paddle attachment and mix on low speed for a minute.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the warm yeast water into the bowl with the mixer running. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a round and coat it lightly with olive oil. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles in size, 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two balls and let them rest for 10 minutes. Working one piece at a time, on a lightly floured surface, flatten the dough into a disk and then pull and stretch the edges to form a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or pizza stone. Add your toppings and bake in a 500°F oven for 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Voila! Your Garlic Bread is ready.</li>
    </ol>
